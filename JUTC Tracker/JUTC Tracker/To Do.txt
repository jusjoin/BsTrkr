Priority
--Completely rethink and redesign busroute table and system of speed and location identification for buses
		since map will be updated at regular intervals the buses must be shown in between stops
		try something with the distance the bus has travelled since last stop or away from origin
--Add validation to add stop to ensure stop doesnt already exist


Secondary
-When stop is added reload stops lists (delete box, )
-Admin page gridview to manage other tables
-break delete stop dropdownbox into city/area/town and refresh after add stop
-add tags to each stop so stops can be searched for by town, area, parish, shops nearby, street name, schools, businesses, attractions(link attractions to google searches)
-add area which shows you buses going to which attraction(hope gardens, utech - BIG recognised places)
-update to google maps api v3 code



-Do user pages allow:
		+see buses on map
		-add profiles and user restrictions
		-create event notification
		-see timetable

-Phone send message request
-fix stopsToGo webservice


Aesthetics
-Information sent to user should  have timestamp and server's time so they know how long ago the bus was at the shown location
-When you press ok on the marker dialog, have a button to send the data to whichever box you want, *this may need designing your own
	dialog box (if the dialog box is java script and not .net **not sure so i need to check)
-Add bus information to RFID Reader Sim
-Use different colour marker based on colour of bus

Ideas
-Make call to database every 10 seconds and load all necessary data into global application state so that each person
accessing the website doesn't cause a call to the database
-Secure data connection from gps devices
-Secure xml files by md5 checksum to make sure not tampered or by date modified check

DEV NOTES
calling an event on a .net element with (null, null) arguements will safely trigger the event
